# Proxmox Maintenance & Security

This repository provides a Bash script that automates a wide variety of maintenance and security tasks on a Proxmox host. The script is intended to help manage updates and perform security scans on your system and containers, while sending notifications with the results. **Use at your own riskâ€”I take zero responsibility for any outcomes.**

## What Does the Script Do?

The script performs the following actions:

- **Proxmox Host Updates:**  
  Updates the Proxmox host to the latest package versions.

- **LXC Container Updates:**  
  Checks for Internet connectivity and updates LXC containers to ensure they are running the latest packages.

- **Docker Container Updates:**  
  If Docker is detected on the Proxmox host, the script automatically updates running Docker containers.

- **Security Scanning:**  
  Runs multiple security tools to scan your system:
  - **ClamAV:** for malware scanning.
  - **RKHunter:** to detect rootkits.
  - **Lynis:** for a comprehensive system audit.

- **NPM Vulnerability Checking:**  
  If Node.js and npm are installed on the system, and if a Node.js project (e.g., containing a `package.json`) is detected, the script runs `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies.

- **Discord Notifications:**  
  Sends update and security scan results via a Discord webhook.  
  **Important:** Do *not* hard-code sensitive settings such as your Discord webhook URL in the repository. Instead, store these details in a local configuration file that is excluded from version control.

## Configuration

Before running the script, create a local configuration file (for example, at `$HOME/.proxmox_update_config`) and add your specific settings:

- **BACKUP_PATH:** Path where backups will be stored.
- **DISCORD_WEBHOOK:** Your Discord webhook URL.
- **Other Parameters:** Any additional settings required for your updates or scans.

*Remember: All sensitive data must remain local and must never be committed to the repository.*
